Create the image (once):

     ./do build                # build the image

Create a container from the image

     vi ./docker-compose.yml   # modify the path of your local source directory in docker-compose.yml
     ./do up                   # craete a container from the image an start it 

Work with the conatiner:

     ./do stop
     ./do start
     ./do login                # jump in to the container
     ./do rm                   # remove the container
